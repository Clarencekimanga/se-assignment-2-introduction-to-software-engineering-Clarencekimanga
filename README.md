# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Software engineering is the processes of designing and implementing and maintaining software products to solve a certain problem. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
software engineering is the process of designing and deploying software products. It defers from the traditional SDLC in that the traditional one is not flexible. It is difficult to accommodate changes due to the sequential nature of models. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1. Agile: It priotizes iterative and adaptable software development, customer involvement, and team collaboration. It breaks a larger project down into cycles. 
2. Waterfall model : this a traditional approach to software development that follows a linear and sequential process. The  process is divided into phases where each phase must be completed before proceeding into the next phase. The phases include: 
planning, requirements gathering, systems design, implementation, testing and deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
: Agile is flexible, iterative and involves continuous customer feedback and adjustments throughout the project with testing performed concurrenttly with development. while waterfall model is linear and sequential where all requirements to defined upfront, where testing is performed after each dev phase.  

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
: Requiremnts engineering is the process of identifying all the requirements necesssary for the development of a software software. The processes involved include: feasibility study, requirements elicitation and analysis, software requirement specification and software requirement validation. It helps in making the software dev efficient.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
: It involves breaking down a system into smaller manageable components, where each module is assigned a specific function. It improves maitainability by allowing easier updates and maintenance of each module without affecting the entire system. It improves scalabilty as it is easier to add new features. 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
1. unit testing: individual component of the system are tested. the goal is to validate that each unit is working appropriatly.
2. intergration testing: multiple units are combined and tested as a group. the goal is to expose faults in the intergration between the units. 
3. system testing: the entire system is tested to verify that it  meets the specified requirements. 
4. acceptance testing: it is done to ensure that the system is ready for delivery. 
testing is crucuail in that errors are detected in advance, which reduces inconviniences.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
: They help manage changes to source code over time. they keep a record of all the changes made to a codebase. they enhance collaboration between developers, they track changes, they help in disaster recovery. some examples include: Git, Perforce Helix core, Mercurial, Subversion. 

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Project Management:
: A project manager manages the dev of software projects. The manager: plans, executes, communicates, undertake risk management, and does quality assuarance. CHALLENGES FACED: time constraints, unclear and undefined expectations, poor communication, changing technologies. 

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance:
It is a process that involves modifying and updating software after its initial release. It enhances functionality, adapt to a changing environment, correct faults, improve perfomance. 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. data privacy 
2. security
3. accessibility
4. social impact 
5. transparency. 
Engineers must make sure they balance technicla responsibilities with moral consideration.
